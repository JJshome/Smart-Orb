# Smart Orb

An advanced wearable smart device for exercise enhancement using electrochemical impedance and TENS-based multi-sensory integrated neuro-modulation.

![Smart Orb Concept](https://github.com/JJshome/Smart-Orb/assets/107289883/1a2a3456-0f8b-4c78-8d99-30d61c5e6de7)

## Overview

Smart Orb is a spherical handheld device that integrates multiple sensing and stimulation technologies to enhance physical performance, facilitate recovery, and improve overall well-being. This device leverages electrochemical impedance measurement and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) along with multi-sensory feedback to provide a comprehensive neuro-modulation solution.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Sensory Integration**: Combines visual, auditory, tactile, and thermal stimulation for a holistic sensory experience
- **Electrochemical Impedance Analysis**: Real-time body composition and physiological state assessment
- **Adaptive TENS Stimulation**: Personalized electrical stimulation patterns tailored to individual needs and activities
- **AI-Powered Control System**: Edge AI processing for real-time adaptation to physiological signals
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Seamless integration with complementary body-worn sensors and stimulators

## Applications

- **Exercise Enhancement**: Optimize workout performance, improve muscle recruitment, and accelerate recovery
- **Pain Management**: Non-pharmaceutical approach to managing chronic and acute pain
- **Sleep Enhancement**: Facilitate deeper, more restorative sleep through targeted neuro-modulation
- **Stress Reduction**: Real-time stress monitoring and adaptive relaxation protocols

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Components

- **Sensors**:
  - PPG (photoplethysmography) for heart rate and SpO2
  - GSR (galvanic skin response) for stress monitoring
  - EMG (electromyography) for muscle activity
  - EEG (electroencephalography) for basic brain activity patterns
  - Electrochemical impedance sensors for body composition

- **Stimulation Elements**:
  - Micro LED array for visual stimulation
  - Microphone and speakers for audio feedback
  - High-resolution vibration motors for tactile feedback
  - Peltier elements for thermal stimulation
  - TENS electrodes for electrical nerve stimulation

- **Processing**:
  - Edge AI chip for real-time signal processing
  - Bluetooth 5.0 for wireless connectivity
  - Energy harvesting system for extended battery life

### Exercise Enhancement Module

The exercise enhancement module optimizes workout performance through:

1. **Real-time Exercise Detection**: Automatically identifies exercise type through motion patterns
2. **Adaptive Stimulation**: Adjusts stimulation parameters based on exercise phase (warmup, main, cooldown)
3. **Fatigue Management**: Modifies stimulation to compensate for muscle fatigue during extended workouts
4. **Recovery Optimization**: Specialized stimulation patterns to accelerate post-workout recovery

## Getting Started with Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Joblib
  - pytest (for testing)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJshome/Smart-Orb.git
cd Smart-Orb
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Simulation

```bash
cd code/exercise_enhancement
python test_stimulation_controller.py
```

This will run three different exercise simulations and generate visualization plots in the `output/` directory.

## Future Development

- Integration with real-time biometric sensors
- Mobile application for configuration and data visualization
- Cloud-based analytics for long-term performance tracking
- Additional modules for cognitive enhancement and meditation support

## Research Background

Smart Orb builds on extensive research in neurostimulation, electrochemical impedance analysis, and multi-sensory integration. Key findings from scientific literature demonstrate that:

- Multi-sensory stimulation produces stronger neural responses than single-modality stimulation
- Personalized TENS parameters based on individual physiology yield superior outcomes
- Closed-loop systems that adapt in real-time to physiological changes show improved efficacy
