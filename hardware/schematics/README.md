# Hardware Schematics

This directory contains electrical schematics and PCB designs for the Smart Orb.

## Main Components

- Main PCB with microcontroller and power management
- Sensor array PCB for physiological measurements
- Stimulation circuit PCB for TENS delivery
- LED and haptic driver circuits

## Safety Considerations

The Smart Orb electrical design incorporates multiple safety features to prevent any risk to users:

- Optical isolation between sensing and stimulation circuits
- Current limiting for all stimulation outputs
- Multiple redundant safety checks in hardware and firmware
- Low-voltage operation where possible
